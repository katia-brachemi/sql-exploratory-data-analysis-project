# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **step‑by‑step exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow in SQL**.  
The goal is to explore, clean, and analyze a relational dataset to uncover meaningful business insights.  

The workflow was inspired by a tutorial video, which provided the initial structure and sequence of analysis.  
However, I extended the project with **additional queries, custom analyses, and personal observations** to deepen the exploration and highlight my own analytical approach.  


 This project highlights how SQL alone can be used to:
- Profile database structure and dimensions
- Summarize measures and distributions
- Identify trends, rankings, and performance drivers
- Build customer and product reports for decision‑making

---

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the database  
- Explore categorical and temporal dimensions  
- Analyze numeric measures   
- Answer key business questions about customers, products, and performance  
- Provide recruiter‑friendly documentation of SQL analysis skills

📊 ##Key Questions Answered by This Analysis

This SQL analysis explores the dataset from multiple analytical angles to provide a complete understanding of business performance. The key questions addressed include:

🗂️ **Database Exploration**

--● What tables and columns exist in the database?
--● How is the data structured across fact and dimension tables?

🌍 **Customers & Products**

--● Which countries do customers come from?
--● What product categories, subcategories, and products are available?

📅 **Time Coverage**

--● What is the time range of the sales data?
--● How many years of sales history are available?
--● What is the age range of customers?

📈 **Sales Performance Overview**

--● What is the total revenue generated?
--● How many items have been sold?
--● What is the average selling price?
--● How many orders, customers, and products are in the database?
--● How many customers have placed at least one order?

📊 **Magnitude Analysis**

--● How many customers are there per country and per gender?
--● How many products exist in each category?
--● What is the average product cost per category?
--● How much revenue does each category generate?
--● How are sales quantities distributed across countries?
--● Which customers generate the most revenue?

🏆 **Ranking Analysis**

--● Which products and subcategories generate the highest revenue?
--● Which products perform the worst in terms of sales?
--● Who are the top revenue-generating customers?
--● Which customers placed the fewest orders?

⏳ **Trend & Change Over Time**

--● How do orders evolve year over year?
--● How does revenue change over time by product category?
--● What percentage of total yearly revenue does each category contribute?
--● How does monthly sales performance evolve in terms of revenue, customers, and quantities sold?

🧠 **Customer Behavior Analysis**

--● How recent are customers’ last purchases?
--● How frequently do customers place orders?
--● How much do customers spend overall (RFM analysis)?
--● How does average spending vary by gender and age group?

🚚 **Delivery Performance**

--● What is the average shipping delay?
--● What percentage of orders are delivered on time?
--● How does shipping performance vary by country and product line?

## Credits
This project builds on the tutorial "[SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project | Full Hands-On Portfolio Project](https://youtu.be/6cJ5Ji8zSDg?si=HyR-y0tn7A14HM8u)" by Baraa Khatib Salkini.  
The dataset and initial structure were introduced in the tutorial, but in my previous project **sql_data_warehouse_project**, I performed the data cleaning myself. Here, I build on that cleaned dataset and extend the work with **custom SQL queries, documentation, and analysis** to highlight my own approach and insights.
