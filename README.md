# 📊 SQL Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **step‑by‑step exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow in SQL**.  
The goal is to explore, clean, and analyze a relational dataset to uncover meaningful business insights.  

The workflow was inspired by a tutorial video, which provided the initial structure and sequence of analysis.  
However, I extended the project with **additional queries, custom analyses, and personal observations** to deepen the exploration and highlight my own analytical approach.  


 This project highlights how SQL alone can be used to:
- Profile database structure and dimensions
- Summarize measures and distributions
- Identify trends, rankings, and performance drivers
- Build customer and product reports for decision‑making

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and quality of the database  
- Explore categorical and temporal dimensions  
- Analyze numeric measures   
- Answer key business questions about customers, products, and performance  
- Provide recruiter‑friendly documentation of SQL analysis skills

## Workflow
Scripts are organized sequentially to reflect the EDA journey:

## Credits
This project builds on the tutorial "[SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project | Full Hands-On Portfolio Project](https://youtu.be/6cJ5Ji8zSDg?si=HyR-y0tn7A14HM8u)" by Baraa Khatib Salkini.  
The dataset and initial structure come from the tutorial, but I extended the work with custom SQL queries, documentation, and analysis.
